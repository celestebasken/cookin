### Welcome to Curated by Celeste!

I'm a high school student from the DC metro area who enjoys cooking and baking! I taught myself to cook from internet blogs like this one and cookbooks from renowned chefs, and I created this blog to give back to that community and help other people get more comfortable in the kitchen!

On this blog, you will find some recipes that I put together myself and others that I adapted from other sources (always credited!). As you may see, however, I'm not much of a strict recipe-follower*, and I believe that the best directions come from your own tastebuds, and you need to check things yourself to see how you like them.

* This is not true of real baking, like bread baking, which is a science and often has measurements for a reason. But skepticism is healthy!

All of my recipes are meat-free, as I am a pescatarian (I do eat fish and seafood, along with eggs and dairy, but not poultry or meat). This is primarily for sustainability reasons, and I hope everyone can enjoy more meat-free meals to help protect the planet. It's all about working in the right direction- I certainly try to avoid fish and dairy as well if I can help it. I don't subscribe to any particular diet or regime, and I think the main thing is to eat more plant-based and enjoy the food you eat!

This website may seem a little non-traditional, because I made it myself in the programming language R, which is typically used for data visualization. If you want to read more about my experience coding, please check out my [R blog](https://celestesrblog.netlify.app/).
